Project description: This project will compile datasets from DataOne of sea otter observations make in the coastal Santa Barbara area in order to identify population trends between 1985 and present day.

Data from DataOne comes from the Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Monitoring Ecological Research (LTER) project and the United States Geological Survey (USGS).


How much data will be collected and how will it be treated?

Two datasets were collected. One was acquired from DataOne and KNB are data repositories. The DataOne dataset has sea otter counts from 2007 in the Santa Barbara Coastal LTER sites, and the KNB dataset has sea otter counts from 2017 and 2018 in the Prince of Wales, Alaska. There is a USGS dataset that sea otter counts 1985 in Santa Barbara, but the dataset was not available to download. We plan to reach out to USGS staff to potentially obtain this data as it would better help us to answer our original question.		

How much time is needed to manage the data and who will be responsible for doing so?

Around 25% of the total project time should be used to manage the data, this includes making sure that data is clean and accessible, uploading relevant files to a repository, and making sure that all the individual data sets can be used together. The team will be responsible for making sure this is done correctly and in a way that can be reproduced. 					
					
How long should the data be preserved and where is the best location to do so?

The data will be preserved on DataONE, as it is a more robust site that hosts a greater number of repositories when compared to some of the other data repository sites like knb. The relevant data will be saved as both a csv and txt file. The csv for now is very accessiable and can quickly be downloaded and used for analysis, however the txt file will most likley be able to withstand time for a longer period. It is a very accessible file as it can be opened by almost any program. 					
Are there any legal constraints associated with acquiring, using and sharing project data?

There are no legal constraints associated with acquiring, using and sharing project data.
