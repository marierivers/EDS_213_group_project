Project description: This project will compile datasets from DataOne of sea otter observations and sea urchin observations in the coastal Santa Barbara area in order to identify population trends between 2007 and present day.

Both datasets are from DataOne and the Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Monitoring Ecological Research (LTER) project.

How much data will be collected and how will it be treated?

Two datasets were collected. Both were acquired from DataOne data repositories. The sea otter counts dataset has sea otter counts from 2007 to 2011 in the Santa Barbara Coastal LTER sites, and the urchin counts dataset has urchin counts from 2007 and 2020 also in the Santa Barbara Coastal LTER sites. 

There is a USGS dataset that has sea otter counts beginning in 1985 in Santa Barbara, but the dataset was not available to download. We plan to reach out to USGS staff to potentially obtain this data as it would better help us to answer our original question.		

The datasets will be individually filtered and mutated so that the two datasets can be combined into a single dataset.

How much time is needed to manage the data and who will be responsible for doing so?

Around 25% of the total project time should be used to manage the data, this includes making sure that data is clean and accessible, uploading relevant files to a repository, and making sure that all the individual data sets can be used together. The team (Marie, Allie, and Halina) will be responsible for making sure this is done correctly and in a way that can be reproduced. 					
					
How long should the data be preserved and where is the best location to do so?

The data will be preserved on DataONE, as it is a more robust site that hosts a greater number of repositories when compared to some of the other data repository sites like knb. The relevant data will be saved as both a csv and txt file. The csv for now is very accessible and can be quickly downloaded and used for analysis, however the txt file will most likely be able to withstand time for a longer period. It is a very accessible file as it can be opened by almost any program. 

Are there any legal constraints associated with acquiring, using and sharing project data?

There are no legal constraints associated with acquiring, using and sharing project data.
