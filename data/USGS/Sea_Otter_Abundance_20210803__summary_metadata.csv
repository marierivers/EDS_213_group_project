Dataset_Abstract,"<para>    These data describe the number, location and activity or behavior of    sea otters (<emphasis>Enhydra lutris</emphasis>) individuals    observed along the Santa Barbara Coast and local Channel Islands,    during SBC LTER field sampling. Observations began in 2007. Records    are collected regularly at SBC core sites and opportunistically    while research staff are underway or travelling between sites.    Locations are included, but some latitudes and longitudes are    approximate.  </para>; <para>The Santa Barbara Coastal LTER (SBC LTER) is an interdisciplinary research and education programestablished in April 2000 with the goal of developing a predictive understanding of how environmentaldrivers interact with terrestrial and oceanic processes to alter material flows and influence the ecology ofcoastal ecosystems. SBC LTER's principal study domain is the semi-arid coast and nearshore waters ofthe Santa Barbara Channel in southern California, and its diverse and productive marine forests of giantkelp (<emphasis>Macrocystis pyrifera</emphasis>) serve as the focal study ecosystem. Analyses of our long-term data haveidentified many of the environmental drivers and ecological processes underlying the production andcommunity dynamics of kelp forests. The research proposed to address this question is integrated in a conceptual frameworkthat focuses on the causes and ecological consequences of the dynamics of a relatively short-livedfoundation species in a setting of long-term climate change and human use.</para>"
Dataset_Methods,"<para>    California sea otter sightings were observed and recorded in the    event log in congruence with all other SBC sampling in the field.    Binoculars were used if the species identification was unclear. Sea    otter location, number, and behavior are recorded any time an    individual is sighted in the field. Often individuals are recorded    while SBC field technicians are en route to a site. Upon arrival to    a site, the surface is scanned for sea otters and binoculars are    used to distinguish otters from other marine mammals including    harbor seals and sea lions.  </para>"
