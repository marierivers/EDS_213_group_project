Dataset_Abstract,"<para>    The dataset comprises weekly to biweekly data on invertebrate    settlement on artificial substrates at six sites in Southern    California, and one site in Northern California. The study began in    early 1990 and is ongoing. The study’s main focus is on urchins    (<emphasis>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</emphasis> and    <emphasis>Mesocentrotus franciscanus</emphasis>), but was expanded    to include selected bivalves, gastropods and crabs during the period    1994-1997.  </para><para>    The purpose of the study is to compare and contrast patterns of    settlement supply across a large geographical gradient to explore    the possible influence of oceanographic features on these patterns.    Both of these goals are facilitated by the long duration of the    dataset, its large geographical range and the high temporal    frequency of collection.  </para><para>    See Methods for more information.    </para>; <para>The Santa Barbara Coastal LTER (SBC LTER) is an interdisciplinary research and education programestablished in April 2000 with the goal of developing a predictive understanding of how environmentaldrivers interact with terrestrial and oceanic processes to alter material flows and influence the ecology ofcoastal ecosystems. SBC LTER's principal study domain is the semi-arid coast and nearshore waters ofthe Santa Barbara Channel in southern California, and its diverse and productive marine forests of giantkelp (<emphasis>Macrocystis pyrifera</emphasis>) serve as the focal study ecosystem. Analyses of our long-term data haveidentified many of the environmental drivers and ecological processes underlying the production andcommunity dynamics of kelp forests. The research proposed to address this question is integrated in a conceptual frameworkthat focuses on the causes and ecological consequences of the dynamics of a relatively short-livedfoundation species in a setting of long-term climate change and human use.</para>"
Dataset_Methods,"<para>    This study aims to follow population dynamics of Sea Urchin settlers    (<emphasis>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</emphasis> and    <emphasis>Mesocentrotus franciscanus</emphasis>) over time and    space. Settlement is measured as the number of individuals found on    85 cm2 wood-backed brushes per day. Brushes are fastened to ropes    and deployed in two week intervals from 1990 to present from the    piers at the following six sites: Anacapa Island, Ellwood Pier,    Gaviota Pier, Stearns Wharf, Scripps Pier, Ocean Beach Pier and    Point Cabrillo (see Temporal, Geographic and spatial coverage page    for GPS coordinates). By 1997 taxonomic coverage at all sites was    extended to include settlement of molluscs and crabs.  </para>; download; https://sbclter.msi.ucsb.edu/external/Reef/Protocols/Invert_settlement_Schroeter/schroeter_2017-12-04_urchin_brush_procedures_complete.pdf"
